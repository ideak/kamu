Kansan Muisti is bringing democracy into a brand new decade.
============================================================

In the beta-version of the Kansan Muisti website, we allow users to
compare campaign statements with actual voting records of current members
of the Finnish parliament. This provides the average voter a chance to
compare platform promises with real-world statistics in order to test and
maintain political fidelity.  Simultaneously, users can comment on all
subjects within the site to make this a freely transparent political
forum.

In the future, users may vote on the same political issues as the members
of Finnish parliament.  The results will be electronically compared to the
opinions of voting parliamentary members and participating political
interest organizations â€” NGO's, corporations, lobbying groups.  These
results will help users gauge whose interests they side with and who to
vote for.

Future versions of the site will also provide easy, centralized access to
information about campaign funding.
