<h1>Are you active in a political-interest organization?</h1>
<p>Do you want to include your organization's viewpoint in a centrally-located
forum?</p>

<p>The average citizen can have difficulty interpreting purely political
issues, and Kamu seeks to provide expert opinions on a variety of
subjects.  We want organizations of all political leanings — from
left-to-right and beyond — to bring focus to major issues addressed within the
Finnish parliament.</p>

<p>Kamu's member organizations will be provided the chance to comment on
legislative proposals and simplify language for the citizens of Finland to
understand.</p>
