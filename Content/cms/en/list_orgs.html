<h1>Are you active in a political-interest organization?  Do you want to
include your organization's viewpoint in a centrally-located forum that
will reach the eyes of millions?</h1>

<p>The average citizen can have difficulty interpreting purely political
issues, and Kamu seeks to provide expert opinions on a variety of
subjects.  We want organizations of all political leanings — from
left-to-right — to bring focus to major issues addressed within the
Finnish parliament.</p>

<p>Kamu's member organizations will be provided the chance to comment on
legislative proposals and simplify language for the citizens of Finland to
understand.</p>
